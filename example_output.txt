When you run `python3 circuit_breaker.py`, you should see output like this:
--- Initial calls ---
Success!
Service failed!
[TRANSITION] → OPEN
CallNotPermittedException (Circuit is OPEN)

--- Waiting to move to HALF_OPEN ---
[TRANSITION] → HALF_OPEN
Success!
[TRANSITION] → CLOSED
Success!

--- After recovery ---
Success!


✅ **Explanation:**
- First call succeeds (CLOSED state).
- Two failures push failure rate > 50% → Circuit trips to OPEN.
- Next call is blocked immediately (OPEN state).
- After wait time → transitions to HALF_OPEN.
- Two successful test calls → transitions back to CLOSED.
- Calls succeed again.
